## Loyola Hacks for Hunger
_Loyola University Chicago Hunger Week 2015, November 2 - 6_ </br> LuTech's plan for a Hackathon event to coincide with the events of Hunger Week. The event will be a hackathon involving Loyola students coming up with creative ideas on how to tackle the issue of hunger either locally, nationally or globally.

### What is a Hackathon?
Hackathons are varying in purpose and design so it may be easier to describe ['Why is a Hackathon a thing?'](https://sendgrid.com/blog/why-hackathon/) instead.

```
For all of these reasons:

Community.
1. To learn & teach.
2. To solve problems.
3. To create something new.
4. To meet like-minded people.
5. To build, because building is fun and rewarding.
6. To gain the respect of peers, through creative expression.
7. To collaboratively push the limits of technology as we know it today.
```
